# Instructions

- `jschurch make` builds the Church compiler in Javascript.
- `jschurch webservice` additionally combines all Javascript needed to run Church code (via scheme2js web service) into a single file.
- `jschurch run filename.church` compiles filename.church to Javascript using the Church compiler generated by make, then runs the program using node.
